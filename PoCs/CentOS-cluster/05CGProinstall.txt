To install a Dynamic Cluster, follow these steps:

    Install and configure CommuniGate Pro Software on all Servers that will take part in a Dynamic Cluster.
    Open the WebAdmin Settings->Access page and modify the PWD service settings. Each Cluster member (Backend and Frontend)
	opens 2 PWD connections to the Cluster Controller, so the maximum number of channels should be increased at least by

        2*(number of Backend servers + number of Frontend servers)

    Since additional PWD connections can be opened by Frontend and Backend servers to serve administrator and user requests,
	it is better to increase the number of channels by:

        5*(number of Backend servers) + 3*(number of Frontend servers)

    Open the WebAdmin Settings->General->Clusters page and enter the IP addresses of all backend and frontend Servers in the Cluster.
    Stop all Servers.
    Create a file directory that will contain Shared Domains. You should create that file directory on a storage unit that will be
	available for all Cluster Backend Servers (on a file server, for example). Place a link to that directory into the CommuniGate Pro
	base directory, and name that link SharedDomains. Make sure that all Backend Servers have all file access rights to create, remove,
	read, and modify files and directories inside the SharedDomain directory.
